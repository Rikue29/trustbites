Despite the effort from the chef to create something unique and fusion, for me the food is either too blend or too mixed up in weird taste that does not match and too overlapping the right taste.\n\nCrew was awesome to create a lively environment, Kudos to few that even had to dance & entertain patron while preparing food.\n\nFor me is a one time hit diner, just to see and feel, done and forget kind of place.",

We tried seafood noodles but the noodles and seafood were emerged in a chicken broth that create a very weird and awful taste . The dish was even bad to look at it (similar to vomit). We highly recommend to remove it from the menu for the sake of culinary basics.\nThe service was good. The waiters were nice but communication wasn‚Äôt good , they couldn‚Äôt explain the food , ingredients maybe the language was a barrier bcz they couldn‚Äôt speak well english.\nPlus it is an expensive place.\nYou rather go to take drink after dinner.",

This charming and consistently reliable tapas bar has stood the test of time, offering a warm, welcoming atmosphere with excellent service and an authentic Spanish experience.\n\nWhat makes Pinchos exceptional is its unwavering quality‚Äîevery dish is prepared with care and consistency, bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. Whether it‚Äôs the classic gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas, or the rotating selection of tapas specials, the kitchen delivers every time. The ingredients are fresh, and the attention to detail shines through.\n\nPricing is also a strong point here: fair and reasonable, especially for the quality of the food and experience. It‚Äôs a place where you can enjoy a great evening without feeling overcharged.\n\nThe staff, especially the waitresses, add to the charm. Friendly, attentive, and professional, they make every visit feel personal and enjoyable‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre a long-time regular or a first-time guest.\n\nPinchos isn‚Äôt just a restaurant‚Äîit‚Äôs a place that feels like a local institution. It‚Äôs perfect for a casual dinner, a date night, or a relaxed evening out with friends. After all these years, it still delivers everything that made me fall in love with it in the first place.\n\nHighly recommended.",
